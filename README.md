### C++11 POSIX message queue wrapper (mq_overview(7))

Should be a pretty straight forward implementation. I messed with the `flags` a bit to make expose a few more properties and to disambiguate READ/WRITE/RW.

See `test.cc` for a usage test.

Still working on packaging and getting this into some of the experimental C++ package managers...
